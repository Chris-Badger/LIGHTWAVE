# Project Description :
LIGHTWAVE is an additive color synthesiser.
Use the RGB sliders to mix source colors.
Syncopated patterns and rhythmic structures can be produced by independently modulating each color with a sinusoidal low frequency oscillator.
The Alpha mod slider modulates the transparency of the total RGB output pre-white efectively adding black from a background layer.
The white level is independant and post RGB as well as Alpha.Â  


# Things to work on:
* The whiteLevel default value does not revert to the slider value when the white lfo is set to 0, but it should.
* All lfo modulators would be better if the lower bound of the mapped sine wave was controllable. As it is, the modulation sweeps between 0 and the upper bound set by the level slider. The LFOs all need a depth control.
* The synthoutput color is currently displayed at the bottom of the page, in a canvas element that is as wide as the window in which it is opened. It would be much better if this canvas could be shown in a different window, or ideally on a different display than the controls. It would be great to be able to send the output to a separate monitor or projector with nothing else on the screen.
* The interface is formatted for a desktop and needs to be refactored for use on a tablet.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
